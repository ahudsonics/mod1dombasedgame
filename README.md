# Guess the Person Game

This is a DOM-based two-player game application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to guess the identity of a famous or historical figure based on their photo and answer questions related to them. Each player takes turns to answer questions in a round of 10 questions.

Technologies Used:

The game application is built using the following technologies:
HTML: The structure of the game interface is created using HTML elements.
CSS: Styling and layout of the game interface are defined using CSS.
JavaScript: The game logic and interactivity are implemented using JavaScript, particularly manipulating the DOM.

Approach:

The game follows a turn-based approach, where players take turns to answer questions. Each question consists of a photo of a person and a corresponding answer that the player needs to guess. After guessing the correct answer, the player is presented with a multiple-choice question related to the person in the photo. Players earn points for each correct answer.

The game keeps track of player scores and displays the result at the end of the game. Players can choose between two modes: playing against another human player or against the computer.

How to Play:

Choose the game mode: You can select either "human" or "computer" mode at the beginning of the game. In "human" mode, two players will take turns answering questions, and in "computer" mode, Player 2's turn will be simulated by the computer.

Guess the Person: The game will present a photo of a famous or historical figure with the question "Who Am I?" Players must enter the correct name associated with the picture to earn a point.

Multiple Choice Question: After guessing the person's name, the game will present a question "What am I Known For?" with multiple-choice answers in radio button form. Players need to choose the right answer associated with the picture to earn another point.

Next Question: After each round, click the "Next Question" button to proceed to the next question.

End of the Game: The game consists of 10 rounds, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. The final scores of both players will be displayed.
